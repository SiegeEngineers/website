### Why Donate?

We pay the running costs for all of <Link to="/projects">our projects</Link> from membership fees and donations.

Since our annual <Link to="/members#Membership-Fee">membership fee</Link> is quite low, the bulk of it has to come from donations.


### Donation Stats

#### 2021

_Since Siege Engineers e. V. was founded in 2021 and has only gradually taken over projects during the year (which partially still have had some balances left), the actual expenses during this year were significantly lower than those calculated on the <Link to="/projects">Projects</Link> page.
However, initial setup costs arose._
