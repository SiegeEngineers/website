# Adding projects

The project tiles are arranged in an alternating 8 - 4 / 4 - 8 pattern. 
Add the new project to a free tile of a suitable size, 
tell us a bit about the project,
make the title a link to the project if possible,
and pick a suitable colour that you like and that is not a neighboring colour. 
You can use any of the eight AoEII player colours as well as dark gray.
